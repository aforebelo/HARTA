# HARTA - Epicardial Fat Segmentation and Quantification Software
HARTA is software developed in the context of a master thesis project (ongoing).
- Rebelo, A. F. O. (2021). Semi-automatic approach for epicardial fat segmentation and quantification on non-contrast cardiac CT. Dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering, NOVA Univer-sity of Lisbon, NOVA Scholl of Science and Technology. Retrieved from: [coming soon]

This application comes as an answer to the time-consuming task of manually seg-menting epicardial fat on CT images. The proposed algorithm uses exclusively basic image operations, so no training steps are required. This software must be seen as a prototype that can be upgraded and optimized with the community's suggestions.

## Getting Started
To use HARTA, follow the next steps:


## Input files
HARTA only accepts cardiac CT datasets in DICOM format (.dcm). Although it runs on contrast-enhanced images, HARTA is optimized for segmenting non-contrast images.
If you do not own any cardiac CT in DICOM format, you can use the public [Visual Lab - Cardiac Fat Database](https://visual.ic.uff.br/en/cardio/ctfat/).
